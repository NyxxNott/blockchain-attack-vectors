Research on Blockchain Security Threats 

## Eclipse Attack Time Dilation Attack - On Bitcoin Lighting Network
- During time-dilation attacks, an attacker controls the victim’s access to the Bitcoin network (hard, but not impossible) and delays block delivery to the victim.

## Flood and Loot Attack - On Bitcoin Lighting Network
- Attackers take advantage of the blockchain congestion and pair it with exploiting the HTLC deadlines.
- The attack relies on the bitcoin blockchain being filled to the brim with transactions so that no more can get through.
- The attacker hopes he or she can push the contracts past the built-in deadlines. If successful, the attacker can begin to "loot" the expired contracts.
- By attacking many channels and forcing them all to be closed at the same time [...], some of the victims’ HTLC-claiming transactions will not be confirmed in time, and the attacker will steal them.
